[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

This is my first Unity 3D Project. It started as an osrs inspired project where you could only do woodcutting but soon it expanded into another 0815 survival game!

### Information
This repository doesn't include any finished assets or graphical improvents since this purpose of the project is only to show off coding and learning unity. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
